> The project uses OOP practices: (in file classes.py)
```
Creating classes
Initialization added
```
Loading of data by categories and products from a JSON file has been implemented. To do this, leave the function enabled that will read the file and create object classes.
For the Category class, I make the product list a private attribute so that it cannot be accessed from outside.

For the Product class, I will create a new_product class method that will accept the product parameters in the dictionary as input and return the created object of the Product class.
